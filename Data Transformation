TRANSFORMATION OF DATA

STEP 1:

I downloaded the dataset, uploaded it using the 'Get Data' option in Power BI, and then proceeded to transform the data.

STEP 2:

The column headers are identified in the first row and should be kept as headers by following the steps below.

STEP 3:

• After promoting the headers, navigate to the 'Transform' tab and select 'Detect Data Type.' This action will automatically identify the data type of each column and convert them as needed. 

STEP 4:

• Split the datetime into date and time stamp
• The aforementioned process starts with selecting the desired column. Following the selection, the option to split the column becomes visible.
• Choose the 'Split Column' option and select the space as the delimiter. 
• Upon completing the data transformation, click on 'Close & Apply' located at the top left. 
• Remember, this step is crucial after any data transformation process.
